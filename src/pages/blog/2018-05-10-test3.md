  Bullet point • is a typographical symbol or glyph used to introduce items in a
  list. The bullet symbol may take any of a variety of shapes, such as circular,
  square, diamond, arrow, etc., and typical word processor software offer a wide
  selection of shapes and colours. Several regular symbols are conventionally
  used in ASCII-only text or another environments where bullet characters are
  not available. Of course, when writing by hand, bullets may be drawn in any
  style. Historically, the index symbol was popular for similar uses.
